## How to use
 - Download the zip file (from the 'clone or download' button)
 - Unzip it into a folder where it won't get moved or deleted
 - In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`
 - Check the box that says 'Developer mode'
 - Click the button that says 'Load unpacked extension...'
 - Choose the _folder_ from the unpacked zip (the whole folder, mind)
